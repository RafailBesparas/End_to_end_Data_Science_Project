# End to End Data Science Project
# Project from the course of MLops I am attending 

# Overview:
This project focuses on predicting wine quality, with a target variable ranging from 1 (bad quality) to 7 (best quality). It demonstrates a complete data science workflow, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment. The goal is to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify wine quality based on various chemical properties.


### Workflows--ML Pipeline

1. Data Ingestion
2. Data Validation
3. Data Transformation-- Feature Engineering,Data Preprocessing
4. Model Trainer
5. Model Evaluation- MLFLOW,Dagshub

## Workflows

1. Update config.yaml
2. Update schema.yaml
3. Update params.yaml
4. Update the entity
5. Update the configuration manager in src config
6. Update the components
7. Update the pipeline 
8. Update the main.py
